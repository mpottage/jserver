/**
 * A flexible TCP Server supporting multiple clients, but without encryption.
 * <p>
 * Higher-level interaction with clients is done by {@link ClientHandler}
 * instances (one for each connection); which are generated by the instance of
 * {@link ClientFactory} supplied in the {@link #Server(int, ClientFactory)
 * constructor}.
 * <p>
 * Text recieved from a client is forwarded to the {@code ClientHandler}
 * instance attached to the connection, by calling {@link
 * ClientHandler#handle(String)}.  It can then process the input and optionally
 * return a response to the client.
 * <p>
 * Messages can be pushed to a client at any time via {@link
 * ClientHandler#popMessage}.
 * <p>
 * There are multiple ways to have a connection to a client closed:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ClientHandler#requestedDisconnect} returns {@code true} for the
 * attached instance.
 * <li>The connection to the client is lost.
 * <li>The {@code Server} is shut down.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * When a client is disconnected {@link ClientHandler#disconnected} is called on
 * the associated {@code ClientHandler}.
 * <p>
 * The server will ensure that no two threads simultaneously access the same
 * instance of a {@code ClientHandler}.
 * It is assumed though that different {@code ClientHandler} instances may be
 * safely accessed simultaneously from different threads. This means that if
 * there is any shared mutable state between instances, then sychronizing access
 * to the shared state is necessary.
